Selected Findings from the Fall 2023 American School District Panel Survey S|###|
ummer programming (along with high-intensity tutoring) is one of the main ways school districts have sought to help students recover academically from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic–related setbacks (Arundel, 2023; Diliberti and Schwartz, 2022; DiMarco and Jordan, 2022; Lehrer-Small, 2022). In fact, when we asked districts to identify in a fall 2023 survey which, if any, of their offerings they deemed most effective at helping students recover academically, summer programming was the second most common answer behind tutoring (Diliberti and Schwartz, 2024). Because school districts are the leading provider of the summer programming to which parents send their children (America After 3PM, 2021), the quality of districts' summer program offerings likely matters for students' pandemic recovery. |###|Importantly, prior research shows that different types of summer programs have been shown to be effective for different student outcomes, such as academic achievement, mental health, and avoidance of risky behavior (McCombs et al., 2019).
