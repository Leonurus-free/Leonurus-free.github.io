【示例】
Isn't Switch Transformer better due to sheer parameter count? Yes, and by design! Parameters, independent of the total FLOPs used, are a useful axis to scale neural language models. Large models have been exhaustively shown to perform better (Kaplan et al., 2020). But in this case, our model is more sample efficient and faster while using the same computational resources.

由于参数数量庞大，Switch Transformer不是更好吗？是的，而且这是设计使然！参数数量，无论总的FLOPs（浮点运算次数）如何，都是扩展神经语言模型的一个有用维度。大型模型已经被广泛证明能表现得更好（Kaplan等人，2020年）。但在这种情况下，我们的模型在使用相同计算资源的情况下，更有效率地利用样本，同时运行速度更快。

 ## Prevalence Of Programming In Summer 2023

Most Districts Across the United States Offered Summer Programs in 2023 Eighty-one percent of districts nationwide offered programming in summer 2023 (see Figure 1). 

We expected this high level of summer programming because three-quarters or more of districts have reported since summer 2021 that they offered summer programming (Schwartz and Diliberti, 2021; Diliberti and Schwartz, 2022).

Percentage of Districts That Offered Programming for Students in Summer 2023, by District Subgroup all) urban districts, large districts, and districts serving mostly students of color offered at least one summer program in summer 2023. 

We suspect there are several reasons that summer program offerings were more common in urban districts than in suburban and rural districts in summer 2023. First, urban districts are typically large enough to reach economies of scale to host summer programming—that is, there are enough teachers and enrichment program partners to enlist to work in the program, enough forms of transportation (whether public transit or busing services) for students to reach the programming, enough facilities that are not shut for maintenance in the summer to How We Defined *Summer Program* **on Our** Survey The term *summer program* refers to any summer 2023 program that districts partially or fully funded from any source. Districts, contractors, and/or one or more community partners might have run the programs. Summer programs can have any academic or other focus. 

host the programming, and enough potential student enrollees to fill classrooms. Furthermore, these districts tend to serve greater shares of students performing below grade level—a population that might have among the greatest need for summer programs.

## Districts Typically Offered Summer Programming To Both Elementary And Secondary Grades

Nationally, 78 percent of districts had a summer program for elementary students (i.e., one that served any grades pre-kindergarten [pre-K]–5), and 70 percent had a summer program for secondary students 
(i.e., one that served any grades 6–12). Sixty-seven percent of districts nationally, or most, had summer programs that served both grade levels (see Figure 2).

![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)

 In the cases in which districts served only one of these two grade levels, it was more common for districts to serve only elementary grades than to serve only secondary grades: 11 percent of districts nationally had a program only for elementary students

and 3 percent had a program only for secondary students.1 As shown in Figure 2, this pattern held in almost all types of districts that we examined. 

We asked the 70 percent of districts nationally that offered summer programming to secondary grades for more detail about what specific grades these programs served.2 (We did not ask a parallel question about specific grades served in the elementary summer programs.) Of those districts with at least one secondary summer program, 82 percent had a program that served at least one middle school grade and 86 percent had a program that served at least one high school grade. In fact, threequarters or more of those districts that offered secondary summer programming offered it to students in each of the grades 6 through 11. Meanwhile, 66 percent of districts offered programming for 12th graders. In other words, districts did not narrowly target their secondary summer programs to specific grades. 

Urban Districts Typically Offered Four or More Summer Programs, Suburban Districts Offered Three, and Rural Districts Offered Two Districts tended to offer multiple summer programs in summer 2023 rather than just a single program. 

As shown in Figure 3, 63 percent of districts nationally offered two or more programs in summer 2023, including 16 percent that offered three and 22 percent that offered four or more. Only 18 percent offered just one summer program (and the remaining 19 percent offered none).

## How This Analysis Was Conducted And Limitations

RAND researchers fielded the eighth survey of the ASDP from October 12, 2023, through December 14, 2023. We designed the 12-minute survey to allow multiple different respondents from the same district central office to complete portions of the survey—for example, a superintendent, human resources director, or research director to answer questions about district staffing levels; an academic director to complete questions about math instruction; and a summer learning coordinator to answer questions about summer programs. We do not know which person(s) in each district completed the survey on behalf of their district. Our methodology for analyzing survey data remains relatively consistent across survey waves; therefore, the description of our methods here is text that we updated from a previous publication (Diliberti and Schwartz, 2023). Starting in fall 2020 and in several waves since, we randomly sampled districts to invite them to enroll in the ASDP. All enrolled districts were invited to complete this survey. Of the 1,167 public school districts that enrolled in the panel between fall 2020 and fall 2023, 231 districts completed surveys (19.8 percent survey completion rate). The districts that took the survey are distributed across 41 states. 

We developed survey weights that, when applied, make the districts in our sample look similar to the national population of K–12 public school districts, at least on such observable characteristics as district locale, enrollment size, poverty level, and student racial and ethnic composition.a Application of these survey weights allows us to interpret our results as nationally representative. For more information about the sampling and weighting procedures for the fall 2023 ASDP survey and to view demographic characteristics for our sample relative to the national population of K–12 public school districts, see Grant et al., 2024. Importantly, survey responses were weighted to be representative of the national population of public school districts, not the national population of public school *students*. Students are not evenly distributed across school districts. More specifically, among the population of 13,000 school districts in the United States, only 7 percent are in urban areas, whereas 25 percent are in suburban areas and 69 percent are in rural areas (Grant et al., 2024). Yet roughly 30 percent of the country's 50 million public school students are enrolled in urban districts (National Center for Education Statistics, undated-a). And the country's 120 largest school districts (which represent less than 1 percent of all public school districts)—many of which are urban—alone account for roughly 20 percent of all student enrollment (National Center for Education Statistics, undated-b). Thus, although rural districts represent a majority of school districts, they do not represent a majority of public school students. Because districts' experiences vary, we examined differences in districts' responses by district context. We obtained data on district demographics by linking survey data files to the 2020–2021 Common Core of Data (CCD) issued by the National Center for Education Statistics (National Center for Education Statistics, 2022). We analyzed the following four categories, which yielded ten subgroups:

- locale (*urban, suburban*, and *rural*)
  b
- student racial and ethnic composition (we categorize districts in which more than one-half of students are Black, Hispanic, Asian, Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaska Native, or of two or more races as having majority students of color, with the remaining districts categorized as having *majority White students*)
- poverty level (districts in which one-half or more of students qualify for a free or reduced-price lunch are categorized as *high poverty*, whereas the remainder are categorized as *low poverty*)

- enrollment size (we categorize districts that enroll fewer than 3,000 students as *small* and districts with more than 10,000 as *large*; we categorize the remaining districts as *medium*). 
  It is important to keep in mind that each district that took our survey belongs to four of the ten subgroups—for example, a single school district that is large, suburban, and low poverty and enrolls mostly White students. Thus, patterns observed across district contexts might be driven by the same set of districts that share multiple characteristics. Figure 17 shows the overlapping nature of these demographic characteristics among the districts in our sample. For example, most districts in the sample—and districts nationally—are small and many of these districts are also rural. These small, rural districts tend to serve predominately White students.

 At the other end, fewer dis-

categories: size (small, medium, and large), locale (urban, suburban, or rural), poverty status (high or low poverty), and student racial and ethnic composition (majority White or majority students of color). Five districts that responded to the survey are not included because of missing demographic information. 

tricts in our sample are large districts. These districts tend to be located in urban areas. Many of these large, urban districts serve predominately students of color. Because of our small sample size, we are unable to disentangle these relationships. In this report, we describe only those differences among district subgroups that are statistically significant at the 5 percent level, unless otherwise noted. We conducted significance testing to assess whether subgroups were statistically different at the p < 0.05 level. Specifically, we tested whether the percentage of districts in one subgroup reporting a response was statistically different from the remaining districts that took the survey (e.g., urban districts versus other districts that are not urban). Because of the exploratory nature of this study, we did not apply multiple hypothesis test corrections. 

Finally, survey responses reflect district leaders' perceptions, which might not align with their actual experiences. Survey items were not pilot tested before administration, limiting our ability to understand how respondents interpreted each item. Furthermore, respondents might not have consistently interpreted terms on the survey which could affect how they completed survey items. 

a Two types of districts in our sample tend to have larger weights than other types of districts: (1) districts that are urban, high-poverty, serve mostly students of color, and have a medium enrollment size and (2) districts that are rural, low-poverty, serve mostly students of color, and have a small enrollment size. 

b Our locale definition aligns with the four-category locale definition used by the National Center for Education Statistics, with the exception that we collapsed the districts located in towns into the rural category for sample size reasons.
